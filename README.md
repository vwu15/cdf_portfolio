- Blurb: This document explains the local issue of food insecurity in the North Side of Binghamton, proposes the Many Hands Food Cooperative as a sustainable solution, and provides ways to get involved. It also contains the event agenda and biographies of the speakers. The document was distributed at the Many Hands Against Hunger Event, which was the project launch event for the cooperative.

**3**   [[Code] Conducting Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BCode%5D%20Conducting%20Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis)

- Blurb: This code allows the user to enter a term or phrase; searches Twitter for tweets containing that term or phrase; classifies those tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral; and returns the percentages of positive, negative, and neutral tweets to the user. The code was a part of my Twitter sentiment analysis research project for a Python programming class. 
- Contribution: As a programming enthusiast, I downloaded API packages, created a graphical user interface for an existing sentiment analysis code, and connected the frontend to the backend using Python.
- Photo Caption: The term "Obama" is entered into the search and the sentiment analysis returns positive results to the user.

**4**   [[Flyer + Guidelines] Organizing Data Design Challenge](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BFlyer%20%2B%20Guidelines%5D%20Organizing%20Data%20Design%20Challenge.pdf)

- Blurb: This challenge asks participants to design a Twitter sentiment analysis to evaluate tweets about the midterm elections. Although no coding is necessary, bonus points are awarded if participants can demonstrate the steps to create the actual program. The challenge was a part of the Binghamton UIF initiative to innovate higher education by encouraging students to explore fields in data science.
- Contribution: As a UIF Fellow, I collaborated with other fellows and student groups on the planning, marketing, and execution of the event.

- Blurb: This survey examines the Broome County brain drain, or high emigration of college graduates leaving the local area, by uncovering primary causes and evaluating potential solutions for the issue. It also assesses demand for a countywide entrepreneurship grant program, which is a student-generated economic development policy. The survey was distributed to college students residing in Broome County.
- Contribution: As a research analyst, I developed the survey, implemented data collection, and analyzed the results.
- Photo Caption: Survey results indicate that 81.04% of the 667 participants are interested in a local entrepreneurship grant program.

- Blurb: This powerpoint explores the success of low-cost carriers in the U.S. airline industry and particularly takes a closer look at Spirit Airlines. The powerpoint was a group assignment for my Global Strategic Management capstone course.  
- Contribution: As an aspiring consultant, I researched various firm strategies and proposed a set of recommendations to complement and enhance Spirit's core competencies. I also created a master slide and customized each slide with my original designs.
