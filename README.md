**1**   [[Annual Report] Tracking Metrics for Projects](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BAnnual%20Report%5D%20Tracking%20Metrics%20for%20Projects.pdf)

- Blurb: This document showcases Binghamton Enactus' social impact projects and their respective metrics for each of the three project phases: (1) "Need", (2) "Action", and (3) "Impact." The document was presented to a panel of judges comprised of business leaders at the Enactus National Competition 2018.

**2**   [[Brochure] Raising Awareness of Food Insecurity](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BBrochure%5D%20Raising%20Awareness%20of%20Food%20Insecurity.pdf)

- Blurb: This document explains the local issue of food insecurity in the North Side of Binghamton, proposes the Many Hands Food Cooperative as a sustainable solution, and provides ways to get involved. It also contains the event agenda and biographies of the speakers. The document was distributed at the Many Hands Against Hunger Event, which was the project launch event for the cooperative.
- Contribution: As a member of the Board of Directors and Steering Committee, I drafted the contents and supervised the design and production of the brochure.

**3**   [[Code] Conducting Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BCode%5D%20Conducting%20Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis)

- Blurb: This code allows the user to enter a term or phrase; searches Twitter for tweets containing that term or phrase; classifies those tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral; and returns the percentages of positive, negative, and neutral tweets to the user. The code was the result of my Twitter sentiment analysis research project for a Python programming class. 
- Contribution: As a programming enthusiast, I downloaded API packages, created a graphical user interface for an existing sentiment analysis code, and connected the frontend to the backend using Python.
- Photo Caption: The term "Obama" is entered into the search and the sentimemt analysis returns positive results to the user.

**4**   [[Flyer + Guidelines] Organzing Data Design Challenge](https://github.com/vwu15/cdfportfolio/blob/master/%5BFlyer%20%2B%20Guidelines%5D%20Organzing%20Data%20Design%20Challenge.pdf)

- Blurb: This challenge asks participants to design a Twitter sentiment analysis to evaluate tweets about the midterm elections. Although no coding is necessary, bonus points are awarded if participants can demonstrate the steps to create the actual program. The challenge was a part of the Binghamton UIF initiative to innovate higher education by discussing relevant topics in data science.
- Contribution: As a UIF Fellow, I collaborated with student groups and three other fellows to plan, market, and execute the event. 
- Photo Caption: Each winner receives a certificate designed by UIF Fellow Vivian Wu and Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Partnerships' Marketing Strategist Cory Kimmell.
