# Welcome to My Portfolio! 

![alt text](https://github.com/vwu15/images/blob/master/Artist.jpg)

My name is Vivian Wu. I am a senior majoring in Accounting with a concentration in Management Information Systems at Binghamton University, State University of New York. 

This is my portfolio for the Civic Digital Fellowship Application 2019. I am applying to the Product Manager role. All work has been accumulated within the past three years since I was a sophomore. I have put my heart and soul into every piece in this repository. I hope that comes across in the quality of my work. 

Thank you so much for your time and consideration!
